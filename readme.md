## The Algorithm

This algorithm works by using a pre-trained classification network and retrains it to recognize the difference between recycling and landfill. Having this pre-trained classification network to build off of makes the algorithm more accurate in less training time than building it from scratch would.

## Running this project

1. Plug a USB camera into the Jetson Nano
2. (still figuring this out)

## The Algorithm

This algorithm works by using a pre-trained classification network and retraining it to recognize the difference between recycling and landfill. Having this pre-trained classification network to build off of makes the algorithm more accurate in less training than building it from scratch would.

## Running this project

1. Run all the code inside of the notebook. 
2. make sure you have a USB camera plugged into the nano
